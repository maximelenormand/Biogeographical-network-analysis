# Biogeographical network analysis of plant species distribution in the Mediterranean region

## Description

The purpose of this work was to develop several tools and metrics to identify 
and characterize the biogeographical structure of a region. As described in 
the paper [[1]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.4718), 
we applied this method to unveil multiscale biogeographical structures in 
plant species distribution in the south of France. We also developed an 
interactive web application to visualize the results.

## Data

The test-value matrix described in 
[[1]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.4718) is available 
in the csv file ***rho.csv***. The table contains 11 columns with column names, 
**the value separator is a semicolon ";"**. Each row represents a plant species.

1.  **ID:** SILENE ID of the plant species
2.  **Name:** Name of the plant species
3.  **Test value bioregion 1:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Gulf of Lion coast" 
4.  **Test value bioregion 2:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Cork oak zone"
5.  **Test value bioregion 3:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Mediterranean lowlands" 
6.  **Test value bioregion 4:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Mediterranean borders"
7.  **Test value bioregion 5:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "CÃ©vennes sensu lato"
8.  **Test value bioregion 6:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Subatlantic mountains"
9.  **Test value bioregion 7:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Pre-Alps and other medium mountains"
10. **Test value bioregion 8:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "High mountains"
11. **Species group:** ID of the plant species group the plant species belongs to. 

## Script

The function **biogeonet** (contained in the script **biogeonet.R**) allows the 
user to compute the matrices **rho** and **lambda** as described in 
[[1]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.4718). 
The input of the function is a three-column data frame where each line gives the 
presence of a given species in a given cell (and its associated bioregion). An 
example of input **data** is available in the file **test_biogeonet.Rdata**. 
The first column is the SILENE ID of the plant species, the second column is the 
ID of the 5x5 km^2 cell where the species is present, and the third column 
represents the bioregion the cell belongs to (obtained with OSLOM).

## Interactive web application

The folder **Vizu** contains all 
the material (R scripts, Rdata and www data folder) needed to run 
[the app](https://biogeomed.sk8.inrae.fr).

## R package

We recently developed an [R package](https://bioRgeo.github.io/bioregion/) to 
facilitate the use of this function (and more) with R.
