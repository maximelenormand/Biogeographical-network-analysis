Biogeographical network analysis of plant species distribution in the Mediterranean region
================================================================================


## Data

The test-value matrix described in [1] is available in the csv file ***rho_ij.csv***. The table contains 11 columns with column names, **the value separator is a semicolon ";"**. Each row represents a plant species.


1.  **ID:** SILENE ID of the plant species
2.  **Name:** Name of the plant species
3.  **Test value bioregion 1:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Gulf of Lion coast" 
4.  **Test value bioregion 2:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Cork oak zone"
5.  **Test value bioregion 3:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Mediterranean lowlands" 
6.  **Test value bioregion 4:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Mediterranean borders"
7.  **Test value bioregion 5:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "CÃ©vennes sensu lato"
8.  **Test value bioregion 6:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Subatlantic mountains"
9.  **Test value bioregion 7:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "Pre-Alps and other medium mountains"
10. **Test value bioregion 8:** Contribution of the plant species to cluster "High mountains"
11. **Species cluster:** ID of the plant species cluster the plant species belong to.
